Criteria

HTML Document

Added alt text to all images for accessibility standards.

Viewed the source code for semantic htlm - added in the header for website tab.
Had an issue with a link I couldn't seem to solve, will continue to try.

Wasn't certain if I should have added a reset sheet.

Also questioned whether I should have changed the list to a nav but when I looked it
up it spoke to a nav being an actual link outside of the webpage, not within it.

Changed a <div> for search engine optimization to id instead of class.


CSS Stylesheet

Wasn't sure if I should have left the body background color, when I removed it 
nothing happened to the page.

I rearranged the css sheet in the order the html document was in order to follow
the actions easier. Not sure if we should categorize...all headers together, all images together, etc.
but I thought is was easier to follow the page.

I consolidated some things and thought more should be consolidated but wasn't certain
how to do it. 

I spent easily over 15 hours just removed stuff and placing it back in to see what happens.
Also tried to look up coding and see what that would do to some (for instance combining headers)
but I think my lack of knowledge was a hinderance.

If you mark up what went wrong I would like to correct this.
