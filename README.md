Code Refactor - Reviewed the source code and made corrections, added alternative text for all images for accessibility.
Reviewed the ccs style sheet and adjusted or consolidated sections and changed the order of the stylesheet to match the html.

HTML Document

Not sure if all htmls should have a reset sheet

Identified the website in the browser tab to reflect the website's name.

The links were reviewed, possibly could have been changed to <nav> but couldn't make it work. I know <nav> work when you 
  are linking to another web page but am not certain if you can make it link to the same page. The 3rd link social media marketing would
  not click down to it's perspective spot and couldn't figure out why. The other 2 were fine.

Added alt text to all images for accessibility standards.

Changed a <div> for search engine optimization to id instead of class.


CSS Stylesheet

There was a background color for all text being white. When I removed this line it still kept the text white so am not certain if this
  style line was necessary. My completed page ended up turning some text black, specifically in the aside.

I rearranged the css sheet in the order the html document was in order to follow
the actions easier. Not sure if we should categorize...all headers together, all images together, etc.
but I thought is was easier to follow the page.

Did some consolidation and thought there should be a way to consoliday even more, when the properties were all the same but was unsuccessful.
When I tried different codes it didn't look right.

Screenshot of completed work. Was not certain why the aside text was now in black - should change to white and center headers.
